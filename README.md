## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VaishnaviVadla33/TimeTableSheduler.git
cd TimeTableSheduler
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment:
# On Windows:
myenv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üî• Firebase Setup

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Navigate to **Firestore Database** and create a new database (start in test mode)
4. Go to **Project Settings > Service Accounts**
5. Click "Generate New Private Key" and download the JSON file
6. Rename the downloaded file to `firebase_credentials.json` and place it in the project root directory

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Activate virtual environment** (if you created one):
   ```bash
   # On Windows:
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   python app1.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## üìä Uploading Subjects

### Excel File Format

Check the sample Excel file `subjects2.xlsx` in the `uploads/` folder to understand the required format and structure your data accordingly.

### Steps to Upload

1. Navigate to the upload page: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload`

2. Upload your Excel file following the same format as the sample file

3. Timetables will be generated automatically upon successful upload

### Managing Timetables

1. Navigate to `/dashboard` in your browser
2. Click on any class cell in the timetable to access management options:
   - **Reschedule**: Edit the selected class
   - **Swap**: Exchange with another class
   - **Cancel**: Remove the class from the timetable

### Downloading Timetables

1. Go to the upload page (`/upload`)
2. Click the "Download All Timetables" button
3. A ZIP file containing individual Excel timetables will be downloaded automatically

### File Naming Convention

Each Excel file follows this naming pattern:
```
Timetable_<Department>_Sem<Number>_Sec<Letter>.xlsx
```

Example: `Timetable_CSE_Sem3_SecA.xlsx`

## üîß Developer Notes

### Database Structure

Timetables are stored in Firestore collections with the naming pattern: `{Department}_{Semester}_sections`

Each document within a section collection follows this structure:

```json
{
  "department": "CSE",
  "semester": "3",
  "section": "a",
  "timetable": {
    "Monday": {
      "10-11": "Subject Name",
      "11-12": "Another Subject"
    },
    "Tuesday": {
      "10-11": "Subject Name"
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Dependencies

```
Flask==2.3.3
pandas
firebase-admin
openpyxl==3.1.5
XlsxWriter==3.2.0
```

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
